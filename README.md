# Face-Recognition-Attendance-System

This project aims to help teachers take attendance easily in school, through the help of AI, particularly in the field of Computer Vision, where the AI can recognize and classify student's faces, and automatically record the student's presence in the database. In addition, the attendance per class can be sent through a personalized E-Mail for every form teacher. This project uses an offline website with an app pop-up as its platform. The website is equipped with intelligent error-detection features, in case a teacher might make a mistake when uploading a photo, and so on.
