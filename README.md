# Face-Recognition-Attendance-System

This project introduces a digital solution to the manual and time-consuming process of taking attendance in schools. The project utilizes Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision to recognize and classify students' faces and automatically record their attendance status in a database. The attendance records can be sent via email to the form teacher. The program is web-based and equipped with intelligent verification features, such as notifying the teacher if the uploaded image is blurry. This technology streamlines the attendance process, allowing teachers to focus more on teaching.
